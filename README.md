# Breakfastclub

**Breakfastclub** is a multi-agent based social simulation platform of a virtual classroom that was developed to study the effect of different personality types on attention and happiness.
It was developed as part of a Master Thesis by [Manuel Pasieka](http://github.com/mapa17) at
the university [UNIR](http://unir.net), under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Michael Kickmeier-Rust](https://www.phsg.ch/de/team/prof-dr-michael-kickmeier-rust).

From the master thesis abstract:


*Agent-based models have proven to be a useful tool to study complex social phenomena. In this work we have developed a simulation using an agent-based model of a virtual classroom, simulating the behavior of students and adolescents in an autonomous study group. The agent cognition is based on the widely used Big-Five personality trait model, and agent behavior has been aligned with empirical studies showing how specific person- ality traits correlate with academic success. The simulation software was used to compare how different classroom compositions with an increasing ratio of students with Attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prototypical personality traits affect the classroom dynamics. We found a very strong effect of ADHD students on the mean classroom hap- piness and attention. Even a very small number of ADHD students can cause a shift in the behavior of None-ADHD students, decreasing their mean happiness and attention, in addition to more frequent classroom wide quarrels.*
